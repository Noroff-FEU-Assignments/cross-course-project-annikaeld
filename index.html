    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">
      How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web
      security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be
      greater than 250 words
    </p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">
      The client should be aware that there are several types of attacks that
      can be done to websites.<br />

      One form is where the hacker injects a program into your page so that he
      or she can retrieve information stored on the server, such as usernames or
      passwords. It could also be used to delete whole blocks of information
      from your server.<br /><br />

      The site could also be used to bluff clients by looking like the real
      site, but actually there is another program running in the background that
      could lead the user to other actions than the intended actions and so
      tricking them to approve things they are not aware they are approving.<br /><br />

      A good way to combat these threats is by using well known third party
      applications to sanitize all data transferred to and from your site so
      that it cannot be picked up by anyone else.<br /><br />

      Securing your website can start as soon as the site is being built by
      using tools that run for every change of code against security checks and
      flag any change that does not make it past the security test. In this way
      we can make code safer right from the beginning.<br /><br />

      Another good way of making sure user credentials do not hang in the
      browser for too long - because this can make it easier for hackers to
      exploit them - is to implement automatic user time-out. This will result
      in a shorter window of time where hackers can try to steal credentials.<br />
